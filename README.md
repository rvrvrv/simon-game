Simon Game Project for FreeCodeCamp

## User stories:
1. I am presented with a random series of button presses.
2. Each time I input a series of button presses correctly, I see the same series of button presses, but with an additional step.
3. I hear a sound that corresponds to each button, both when the series of button presses plays, and when I press a button.
4. If I press the wrong button, I am notified that I have done so. Then, the series of button presses starts again to remind me of the pattern, so I can try again.
5. If I want to restart, I can hit a button to do so, and the game will return to a single step.
6. I can play in strict mode, where if I get a button press wrong, it notifies me that I have done so, and the game restarts with a new series of random button presses.
7. I can win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct. I am notified of my victory, and then the game starts over.
